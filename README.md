# 👋 Welcome, I'm Dr. Paul Schmelzer

**Empirical Research · Quantitative Analysis · Policy & Environmental Evaluation**

I hold a PhD in Social and Economic Sciences and bring over 20 years of experience in empirical research, quantitative analysis, and policy-oriented evaluation.  
My work bridges **academic research (DIW Berlin, IAB)** and **applied analytical projects** for public institutions and organizations, with a focus on evidence-based decision-making in labor markets, social policy, health systems, and environmental contexts.

This repository provides a **structured overview of my research and policy background**, as well as selected applied and advisory projects.

## 📊 Selected Applied & Advisory Projects

### ♻️ Ecoembes – Environmental Data Analysis & Recycling Behavior (2022–2024)

Joint applied research project with **Ecoembes** (Spain’s national recycling consortium) and **Carlos III University Madrid**.  
The project analyzed **municipal-level environmental and socioeconomic data** to understand regional differences in recycling behavior and container misuse.

I was responsible for **data integration, quality assurance, and empirical analysis** of large-scale regional datasets covering approximately 8,000 municipalities.  
The analyses identified **structural and contextual factors** associated with poor recycling outcomes, particularly in tourism-intensive regions and time-constrained household contexts.

The results provided **evidence-based foundations for environmental policy measures, communication strategies, and targeted interventions** aimed at improving recycling quality and compliance.

At **Vistachic S.L.**, I conducted empirical analyses of sales and product data from retail operations in Spain and France.  
My work focused on **data preparation, harmonization, and structured evaluation** of multi-market sales information.

Based on systematic analysis of historical sales patterns, I identified **key product characteristics and demand drivers** and derived **evidence-based recommendations** for assortment planning and product development.  
The analyses supported **strategic decision-making** in product design, logistics, and market positioning.
